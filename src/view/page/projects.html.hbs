    <h1>The Impact</h1>
    <p>Bringing colour, culture and vibrancy into the suburbs makes areas like Hangleton and Knoll feel included and part of our creative and positive city culture.</p>
    <p>Giving the local community positive, uplifting works of art that can be engaged with on different levels, by the whole community and beyond.</p>
    <p>Creating an identity for H&amp;K beyond ‘the suburban’ by creating a trail for people from  all areas to explore and enjoy, encouraging fitness, health and wellbeing.</p>

  <section class="theart">
    <h1>The Art</h1>
    <p>We have two suggestions for the transformation of our benches:</p>
    <ul class="scribble-list">
      <li>Commissioning local artists from differing disciplines to create a bench in their ‘style’.  For example: illustration, fine art, graphic art, street art etc.</li>
      <li>Approaching companies such as <em>ReWorked</em> and <em>Gomi</em> who repurpose unrecyclable consumer waste into new products, creating pieces of  art in their own right.</li>
    </ul>
