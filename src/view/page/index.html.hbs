      <p><em>Melanie Sramek-Bennett</em> is a freelance Graphic Designer and Art Director with 20+ years experience bringing brands to life.</p>
      <p>I believe in using the visual arts to inspire, uplift and improve the world around us. I believe that great design and unexpected art should be accessible to all and can have huge positive benefits for the community. Alongside design for the commercial world I also created a Snail for the Wild in Art SnailTrail, as well as working with children at two local Primarys’ on their Snow Dog projects.</p>
